Student Name: Willis Allstead
Program Name: Rent-A-Vehicle
Program Purpose: Take input file from user and parse through it using several
different functions.

This project #imports the <iostream>, <iomanip>, and <fstream> libraries.
There is a constant int named CAR_COUNT which is set equal to 10, because the
project description specifies that a file with 10 cars will be supplied in every
case. A struct named rentalCar is then defined to have several properties.
rentalCar has a char array of size 20 named make. This will hold the make of the
a car. Similarly, the struct has a char array of size 20 named model. It also
has an int variable named year, a float to hold the price, and a bool to hold
the car's availability. Below this struct are the prototypes of the 4 functions
used, besides the main. In the main function, an int variable named selection is
set to 0. This will hold the user's selection. There is then a do-while loop for
the menu. As long as the selection is not 6 (the exit selection), the program
will re-print the menu once the selected function is finished running. Inside of
the "do" brackets the menu title is printed to the screen, with some styling.
Then, the 6 options are printed to the screen. Next, the user is prompted to
input their selection. After that, there is an array of 10 rentalCars created.
This will hold the information porvided by the file.
